Different Gas Cap sizes in both layers.
Use the same PROPS_tilted_gas.INC and PROPS_JUSTWATER.INC from Wind_Power folder
"G" data files use the wind_power schedules
"Z" data files are used to test the maximum capacity of the layers; i.e, charge and discharge with the same rate until max capacity is reached.
